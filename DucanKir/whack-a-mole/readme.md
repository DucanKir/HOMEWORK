## Whack-a-Mole

### Introduction

Your task is to create the classic children's game Whack-a-Mole using HTML, CSS and JavaScript!

### Requirements

* Create a grid of squares
* A "mole" should randomly appear in a square every 1000 ms for 750 ms
* If the user clicks on the square containing the "mole" they should get a point
* The game should run for 60 seconds


**Note:** Remember to wrap your code in a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener.

### Bonus

* Make a start game button which starts the countdown timer, and starts the moles appearing
* Make a reset button that resets the score and the timer, ready to play again

### Bonus bonus

* Make the game mobile responsive
* Add sounds
* Add CSS animations (hint: check out [Aminate.css](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/))
